## 🚀 Hackathon Spotlight
**Wellness AI** was designed to bridge the gap between complex medical information and everyday accessibility. In a world where health anxiety is at an all-time high, our goal was to create a tool that is:
1.  **Fast**: Zero-latency responses.
2.  **Private**: All processing happens on the device.
3.  **Human-Centric**: Designed for calm, clear communication during stressful moments.

## 🛑 The Problem
Accessing quick, non-alarming health information is difficult. Users often face "information overload" when searching for simple symptoms, or worse, they miss critical warning signs of life-threatening emergencies. The "Dr. Google" effect often leads to unnecessary panic.

## ✅ The Solution: Wellness AI
A **privacy-first**, **offline-ready** triage companion that prioritizes safety. By using local heuristic matching and a curated medical knowledge base, it delivers instant guidance without sending sensitive health data to any server.

### 🌟 Key Value Propositions
- **Zero Latency**: Local processing ensures immediate responses even in low-connectivity areas.
- **Privacy by Design**: No backend, no cookies, no tracking. Your health queries are yours alone.
- **Calm UX**: Designed to reduce anxiety through a soothing Glassmorphic interface and clear, helpful language.
- **Emergency-First Logic**: Intelligent triage system that detects high-risk keywords (*chest pain, stroke, etc.*) before processing general wellness advice.
